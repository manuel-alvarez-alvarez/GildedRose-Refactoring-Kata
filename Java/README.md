# Gilded Rose kata by Manuel Alvarez Alvarez

The kata has been updated to support **Spring boot**.

## Running the kata

In order to run the test you must execute:

```shell
/> gradlew test
```

To run the rest application:

```shell
/> gradlew bootRun
```

After that the rest controller is accessible at:
 * [GET - http://localhost:8080/items](http://localhost:8080/items) to list all the items
 * [POST - http://localhost:8080/items/update](http://localhost:8080/items/update) to update all the items
